Website that directs programmers to software


Capstone Project Outline

The deliverable I would like to develop for this project would be a website that directs users to software that is typically used in the programming environment (i.e. programming tools, collaboration tools and software, open source content, etc.). The webpage would feature multiple pages to categorize the tools and each toolsâ€™ function in the programming environment. This webpage should be compatible for both desktop and mobile devices. I would also like for it to be deployable on Heroku and utilize some form of API.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Professor Suggestions for Consideration...
What framework do you plan to use for this? Deploying to heroku would be a great way to go about it. 
Lets keep it simple and execute well. If your goal is to get into a position like that in GP or TSYS I could suggest several frameworks and the likes (I am a software engineer at TSYS), but the most important thing is to have a good front end and user experience. The languages and frameworks are easier to learn
I would suggest sticking to either Python + Flask and focus on banging out the front end with Bootstrap (makes mobile easy). If youre comfortable already with javascript, and depending on your level I would suggest Node. Jumping from node to React is easier than learning javascript since React is just javascript with a framework. 

pip install flask
